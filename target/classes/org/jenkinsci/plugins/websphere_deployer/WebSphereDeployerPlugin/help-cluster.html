<div>
    The cluster to deploy to. To find the cluster you want to deploy to, simple look at the path where IBM WebSphere Application Server was installed. (i.e. '[WAS_INSTALL_ROOT]/profiles/[PROFILE]/config/cells/[CELL_NAME]/clusters/[CLUSTER_NAME]').

    This property is optional, if left blank it is assumed that no application cluster is defined and the plugin will try to deploy directly on the server. If you have defined a cluster of applications though, you have to specify this property.
